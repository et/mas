# mas-cli

A simple command line interface for the Mac App Store. Designed for scripting
and automation.

## Install

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is the preferred way to install:

    brew install mas

Alternatively, binaries are available in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/releases)

## Usage

Each application in the Mac App Store has a product identifier which is also
used for mas-cli commands. Using `mas list` will show all installed
applications and their product identifiers.

    $ mas list
    446107677 Screens
    407963104 Pixelmator
    497799835 Xcode

It is possible to search for applications by name using `mas search` which
will search the Mac App Store and return matching identifiers

    $ mas search Xcode
    497799835 Xcode
    688199928 Docs for Xcode
    449589707 Dash 3 - API Docs & Snippets. Integrates with Xcode, Alfred, TextWrangler and many more.
    [...]

To install or update an application simply run `mas install` with an
application identifier:

    $ mas install 808809998
    ==> Downloading PaintCode 2
    ==> Installed PaintCode 2

> Please note that this command will not allow you to install (or even purchase) an app for the first time: it must already be in the Purchased tab of the App Store.

Use `mas outdated` to list all applications with pending updates.

    $ mas outdated
    497799835 Xcode (7.0)
    446107677 Screens VNC - Access Your Computer From Anywhere (3.6.7)

> `mas` is only able to install/update applications that are listed in the Mac App Store itself. Use [`softwareupdate(8)`](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/softwareupdate.8.html) utility for downloading system updates (like iTunes, Xcode Command Line Tools, etc)

To install all pending updates run `mas upgrade`.

    $ mas upgrade
    Upgrading 2 outdated applications:
    Xcode (7.0), Screens VNC - Access Your Computer From Anywhere (3.6.7)
    ==> Downloading Xcode
    ==> Installed Xcode    
    ==> Downloading iFlicks
    ==> Installed iFlicks    

Updates can be performed selectively by providing the app identifier(s) to
`mas upgrade`

    $ mas upgrade 715768417
    Upgrading 1 outdated application:
    Xcode (8.0)
    ==> Downloading Xcode
    ==> Installed Xcode

To sign into the Mac App Store for the first time run `mas signin`.

    $ mas signin mas@example.com
    ==> Signing in to Apple ID: mas@example.com
    Password:

If you experience issues signing in this way, you can ask to signin using a graphical dialog (provided by Mac App Store application):
>
>     $ mas signin --dialog mas@example.com
>     ==> Signing in to Apple ID: mas@example.com

You can also embed your password in the command.

    $ mas signin mas@example.com "ZdkM4f$gzF;gX3ABXNLf8KcCt.x.np"
    ==> Signing in to Apple ID: mas@example.com

Use `mas signout` to sign out from the Mac App Store.


## Homebrew integration

`mas` is integrated with [homebrew-bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle). If `mas` is installed, and you run `brew bundle dump`, then your Mac App Store apps will be included in the Brewfile created. See the [homebrew-bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) docs for more details.

## When something doesn't work

If you see the error "This redownload is not available for this Apple ID either because it was bought by a different user of the item was refunded or cancelled.", it's probably because you haven't installed the app through the App Store yet. See [#46](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues/46#issuecomment-248581233).

If `mas` doesn't work for you as expected (e.g. you can't update/download apps), run `mas reset` and try again. If the issue persists, please [file a bug](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues/new)! All your feedback is much appreciated âœ¨

## Using `tmux`

`mas` operates via the same system services as the Mac App Store. These exist as
separate processes with communication through XPC. As a result of this, `mas`
experiences similar problems as the pasteboard when running inside `tmux`. A
[wrapper tool exists](https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard) to
fix pasteboard behaviour which also works for `mas`.

You should consider configuring `tmux` to use the wrapper but if you do not wish
to do this it can be used on a one-off basis as follows:

```
$ brew install reattach-to-user-namespace
$ reattach-to-user-namespace mas install
```

## Build from source

You can now build from Xcode by opening `mas-cli.xcodeproj`, or from the Terminal:

```
$ script/build
```

Build output can be found in the `build/` directory within the project.
